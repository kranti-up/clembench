A shape can be placed in any cell, while stacking involves adding multiple shapes to the same cell, increasing its depth. Shapes typically occupy a single cell, except for the \"bridge,\" which spans two cells and requires two other shapes for stacking. Horizontal bridges span adjacent columns (left and right), and vertical ones span consecutive rows (top and bottom). Stacking is only possible if the shapes have matching depths.\n\nIn the grid, columns align with the x-axis and rows with the y-axis. Python indexing is used to identify each cell. The cell in the top-left corner is in the first row and first column, corresponding to x and y values of 0, 0. Similarly, the top-right corner cell is in the first row and eighth column, with x and y values of 0, 7.\n\n- Use the shape name 'bridge-h' if a bridge is placed horizontally\n- Use the shape name 'bridge-v' if a bridge is placed vertically\n\nThe following functions are already defined; therefore, do not generate additional code for it\n- Use `put(board: np.ndarray, shape: string, color: string, x: int, y: int) to place a shape on the board\n\n\nFor each instruction labeled Instruction, please respond with code under the label Function followed by a newline and usage for the function under the label Usage followed by a newline.\n\nInstruction\nThese are the instructions to build ws.
