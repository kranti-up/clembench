The goal is to make each instruction standalone, providing enough information for someone to follow it without having read the earlier parts of the conversation.\n\nFor each instruction labeled \"Instruction\" please respond with rewrite under the label \"Rewrite\" followed by a newline.\n\nDo not generate any other text/explanations. Do not generate the instructions on your own. Stick to the given format. Think step by step.\n\nLet's get started.\n"}]}]}
